# Moonshot #5 Carpe Distributed Oracle

## Participants:
Multiple participants are allowed and encouraged. Competitive or collaborative participants receive equal rewards.

[NONE]

## Reward Cap:
500,000 GAS Coins. 1% of Moonshots Funds. 0.05% of 0L Network supply.

## Brief: 
Leverage the Carpe distributed mining community to make the work they are providing useful to the network. Achieve this by making Carpe nodes into validator "feeders".

## Plausible Solutions:
Leverage the Carpe VDF "Delay Towers" as a randomness generator. Also use the tower height as a reputation gate. In this manner there is reputation, randomness, and bonding as a mitigation of sybil behavior. A simple market (or protocol for markets) for requesting oracle data would be needed. The solution must consider selecting oracle submissions from random samplings of the market of oracle requests. 

The development will be split with the on-chain stdlib code, and the Carpe client side submissions.

## Evaluation and rewards:
- 100,000 - Plan - Develop a plan and roadmap.
- 200,000 - Prototype - Using VDF proofs create a verifiably random way of picking oracle submissions, have Carpe, submit the request.. 
- 200,000 - Features Development - Develop the reputation (tower height), and bonding for the submission of data. Create the rate-limiting of transactions so network is not overloaded with oracle transactions.
- 400,000 - MVP - Develop the market place for submitting the feed requests, establish the fund for the bootstrapping subsidy. 
- 100,000 - Ship - Merged to a mainline 0L branch.

## Milestones and Payments:
